# Basics of Computer Science

## Lesson 2

## Binary,Bits and Bytes  

**Why do we need computes?**  

In simple term,to do our thinking job easier and faster.

***

**What is Binary?**  

Binary is a numeric system that only uses two digits â€” 0 and 1.Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones.  

A single digit in binary is known as a binary digit.

***

**What is Bit?**

In computer terminology, one piece of information which can store either 0 or 1 is called a bit.

***

**What is Byte?**

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits.
(Smallest addressable memory size)

8 bits make 1 byte  

2^8 Permutations = 256 different values we can represent.  

Just think of your keyboard upper and lowercase A-Z, a-z, numbers, and the various special characters.

**Why 8-bit as Byte?**  

In 1950's and 60's there were several computer architectures that used multiples of 6-bits as a unit of storage.

Later in 1970's for the convienience it is decided as 8-bit.Especially the hardware companies started following the 8-bit for the design of integrated circuits.
